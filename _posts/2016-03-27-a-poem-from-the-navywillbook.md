## A poem or song that I wrote in m willbook while aboard USS Reuben James FFG-57 between January 1999 and October 2000\.

**Misconceptions**

## "These misconceptions manifest doubt within my heart,

## I've been handed a role, that of the fool, and I always play my part.

## This Emptiness that is my Soul's description,

## Leaves me bereft and sets me to conniption.

## Inexplicably I fail to learn, though given many chances,

## My heart is impaled upon Emptiness's antiseptic lances.

## There is no hope for me, I so quickly fall in love,

## Over the edge of singularity's fateful cliff, 

## This incomplete person I have shoved."
