## Apparently I was feeling contemplative when I lived aboard the USS Reuben James (FFG-57) back in 1999 and 2000\.  The first \[remaining\] pages of my first surviving willbook are a rambling record of what _might_ have passed as a philosophical exploration in the mind of a soon-to-be-ex-teenage Sailor. Transcription to follow the image of the willbook's first page below:

## "The world around us is full of symbols. It is up to the individual to decide what they mean.

## "The search for originality is in itself unoriginal. Just 'be' and the uniqueness which you seek will present itself.

## "As creatures of independent thought, we possess more power than we often care to admit, for nothing in our world exists until we acknowledge it. An apple only becomes an apple when we call it so. Until then it merely 'is'."

## "Spirituality: The acceptance and celebration of our humble station in this universe. No more, no less.

## "Modernism (materialism): The denial of our humble station in this universe and the search for that  which will artificially and temporarily bring us up in station.

## "In spirituality, acceptance without celebration is like inhaling without exhaling when breathing. Neither is complete without both aspects and are therefore useless.

## "It is important to understand modernism because one cannot escape the times in which they live.

## "Modernism and Spirituality are similar to oil and vinegar. They are hardly palatable on their own but combine to form a pleasing final product. However, they always remain as separate entities, as a result of their own natures, and therefore must be honed independently to achieve their highest potential of quality when combined.

## "Those who are strong spiritualists will call for the revocation of materialism and so too in reverse. Those strong materialists will call for the revocation of spiritualism. However, he who manages to embrace both traits possesses a combined strength that makes his condition favorable to that of his peers.

## "Think logically, and admit when you are wrong."
