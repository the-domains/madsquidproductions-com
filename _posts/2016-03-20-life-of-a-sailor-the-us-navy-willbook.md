## When I was in the Navy and living aboard FFG-57 (January 1999-September 2000),  I always carried with me a small, green notebook that we referred to as a "willbook." Perhaps this was because if it was in your pocket, and you had recorded your last rites in it, it might be recovered upon your death and serve as a will. I'm not really sure. All I know is that I used them to record everything from random thoughts to love songs and phone numbers. I still have a couple of them, and will here be recording their contents:
