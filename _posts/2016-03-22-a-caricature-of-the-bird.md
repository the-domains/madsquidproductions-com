## I kept my willbook(s) in the breast pocket of my coveralls at all times. I drew this little figure so that I could call a shipmate over, pull out my notebook and say something to the effect of, "Hey! Hold on, I wrote something down for you.  . ." 

## Then I'd flip to the page of this hand flipping them the bird. Sometimes I just got tired of _saying _"Fuck you."
