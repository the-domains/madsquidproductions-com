  On election day 2012 I worked a 12-hour shift to get out the vote for
  President Obama at Colorado Mesa University. When I arrived at 7:00 a.m. there
  were Romney signs ALL OVER the grounds around the University Center. Being
  that CMU is a state school, and that the signs were surrounding the polling
  station, this was illegal.
