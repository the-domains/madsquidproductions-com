\#NavyWillbook
![The kids scribbled in this willbook at some point with crayons.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/768ed295-d0b5-44f8-9f5c-fd58e1a0217c.jpg)

## A song that I wrote in my willbook. Apparently the song began as a seed planted by the girl I met in my hometown after bootcamp. But I distinctly remember writing this song for the Haole Hawaiian girl that I "fell in love with" while living on Oahu. Both are named at the top of the 1st page, oddly enough. Anyway, the melody that I've always heard in my head when I think of this song is along the lines of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, or possibly even Tom Jones. Enjoy!

# If Eyes Were Diamonds

## "If eyes were diamonds, we'd be richer than sin, with just your two...

## "And if time were a dime, then I'd spend every penny that I have on you...

## "If euphoria were money, then your sweet scent could pay the rent...

## "And if looks could kill, oh boy I'd be in trouble, because you'd use no relent...

## "If life were black and white, then everything within your sight would shine a new hue...

## "And if I could choose one, just one, It would always be you!"

## "I'd climb to the top of the highest mountain, just for a single glimpse, of your sweet, soft lips...

## "And if I could work magic, then for the grace of your heart I'd do 1,000,000 tricks...

## "Across the seven seas, I'd row a leaky boat, just to take your hand...

## "And once it was mine, I'd cover it in jewels, the finest in the land...

## "Women who match your beauty, in this great big world, are found far and few...

## "And I'd trek a barren desert, facing certain death, so it could be just us two...

## "And if I could choose one, just one, it would always be you!"
