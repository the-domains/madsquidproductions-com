![Yes, in Hawaii a breeze can be warm AND crisp. >-\](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3028f61e-7d63-4ba3-a62b-bbb433bf79ca.jpg)

## This is a short poem that I wrote about the moment that I realized that I had "fallen in love with" D.C. I was in her (parents) house hanging out with her one afternoon before I had to get underway for a short, 3 or 4 day exercise of some kind on the Reuben James, possibly to Hydrofest. Someone called and when the phone rang, she picked it up. The light fell just perfectly through the open window onto her neck as she answered, and time slowed down. I remember feeling _perfect _in that moment. Proper, somehow. Anyway, this is the ridiculous poetry that sprang forth as a result. Incidentally, she dumped me (the 1st time) mere days after this.

# The Moment

"A warm, crisp breeze stirs up thoughts, or emotions  rather, not of past experiences, but of a once plausible future.

"I can feel the happiness sifting through my hair as the breeze lifts me to elation, and I see it, ever so clearly.

"I can see her warm smile, enhancing the pristine glow of a calm summer's day, and I can taste the serenity it brings.

"The sound of mellow chimes plays ever so nicely into my ears, just atop the sound of children laughing a room away.

"Just one glance at her pleases my soul so much that I want nothing more than to see her image forever.

"And as aesthetic as this fleeting encounter is in my mind, I know all too well the truth of its absence."
