            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Banfield Pet Hospital Scam</h1><p>This is a recorded complaint call that I placed to my local Banfield Pet Hospital after being charged for an "Optimum Wellness Plan" for months following multiple cancellation requests, and even re-homing the dog that the plan was purchased for. Over the course of our wellness plan, we experienced multiple instances of poor business ethics on the part of Banfield.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9ec45a22ec54315bb3dbc402942aef9a7092ea0b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Voter Suppression: Election Day 2012</h1><p>On election day 2012 I worked a 12-hour shift to get out the vote for President Obama at Colorado Mesa University. When I arrived at 7:00 a.m. there were Romney signs ALL OVER the grounds around the University Center. Being that CMU is a state school, and that the signs were surrounding the polling station, this was illegal.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e9a3a7ecdacec381550fe8bba0ec9dc3ba46de05.jpg"></article>]]></description>
